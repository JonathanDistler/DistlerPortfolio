My name is Jonathan Distler, and I am a rising Junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, with an emphasis on physics and simulation. I am interested in robotics (especially soft-robotics), aerospace, entrepreneurship, and public policy. I am currently working on the Cornell Hyperloop Project team, developing novel structures to maintain the structural integrity of the Hyperloop pod. I am also conducting research in Dr. Gregory Falco's Adversary Lab, developing an indoor GPS system to accurately query the position of drones. 

I'm an avid reader. So far this year I've read the following books:
- *13 at Dinner* by Agatha Christie  
- *Murder on the Orient Express* by Agatha Christie  
- *Death on the Nile* by Agatha Christie  
- *The Fellowship of the Ring* by J.R.R. Tolkien  
- *The Two Towers* by J.R.R. Tolkien  
- *The Return of the King* by J.R.R. Tolkien  
- *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus  
- *The Sun Also Rises* by Ernest Hemingway  
- *Franz Kafka: The Complete Stories* edited by Nahum N. Glatzer  
- *Treasure Island* by Robert Louis Stevenson
- *Butter* by Asako Yuzuki
- *The Old Man and the Sea* by Ernest Hemingway  
- *Intermezzo* by Sally Rooney
- *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr
