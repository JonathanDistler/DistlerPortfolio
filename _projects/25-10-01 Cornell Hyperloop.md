# Cornell Hyperloop

### Systems Subteam Member – Cornell Hyperloop

As a member of the Systems Subteam on **Cornell Hyperloop**, I contribute to the development of innovative solutions for the team’s structural and integration needs, including the design of the **battery pack enclosure**, **electrical harness routing**, and **microelectronic mounting systems**. I actively participate in **weekly team meetings**, engaging in technical discussions and contributing to decisions on **best design practices**. My responsibilities also include performing **hand calculations** to analyze **heat transfer** into the battery packs and **developing and modeling the stress and strain** behavior of structural components to ensure safety, reliability, and performance. I was also responsible for machining and fabricating different parts for the team, using rapid prototyping strategies like 3D-printing, laser cutting, and milling.
